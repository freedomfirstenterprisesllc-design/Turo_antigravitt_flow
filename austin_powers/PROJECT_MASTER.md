## 🎯 THE 2-LANE CATALOG STRATEGY

> **Core Philosophy:** Serious music builds credibility & revenue. Malodies drive discovery & virality. Both feed the machine.

### 🅰️ LANE A — SERIOUS RELEASES

**Purpose:** Playlist-ready singles for credibility + primary revenue

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Quality | Strong hooks, clean mixes, emotional clarity |
| Cadence | **1 serious single every 3-4 weeks** |
| Goal | Playlist placements, Spotify algorithmic love, streaming revenue |

### 🅱️ LANE B — MALODY RELEASES

**Purpose:** Slightly comical/clever "malodies" for discovery + virality

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Length | **30-120 seconds** (short songs or sections) |
| Hook Timing | Start within **first 3-5 seconds** |
| Punchline/Turn | By **15-25 seconds** |
| Audio Quality | Still professional (clean audio required) |
| Cadence | **1 malody/week OR 2 malody clips/week** |
| Source | Prioritize building from existing ideas/assets |

### 🔄 THE FUNNEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every malody post **MUST** include:

- ✅ Link to latest serious single (link in bio / pinned comment)
- ✅ Spotify follow + save call-to-action
- ✅ Drive traffic back to Lane A content

---

## ⚡ USE WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE (RULE #1)

> **Before creating from zero, transform what already exists.**

### Priority Order

1. **Extract best hooks/sections** from current catalog
2. **Rebuild structure** around hooks (shorter intros, faster payoff)
3. **Repurpose existing videos** into 10-30 second clips
4. **Convert concepts into malodies** that drive discovery

## 🤖 AI + n8n OPERATING SYSTEM

### AI Usage Rules (Role Assignment)

| AI Tool | Primary Use Case |
|---------|------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Strategy, calendars, scripts, captions, checklists, release plans |
| **Claude** | Long-form editing, brand voice refinement, lyric rewrites, production notes |
| **Gemini/Antigravity** | Ideation, variations, hook testing, visual concepts |
| **Claude Code** | Automation scripts, file renaming, templates, lightweight tools |

### n8n Automations (To Build)

| Automation | Function | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **Content Log** | Store every song/clip idea + status in tracker | 🔲 Planned |
| **Posting Checklist** | Auto-generate weekly checklist and reminders | 🔲 Planned |
| **Asset Intake** | Auto-organize new files into /assets/audio and /assets/video | 🔲 Planned |
| **Release Pack Builder** | Auto-create release folder (masters, cover, clips, captions) | 🔲 Planned |
