## 🅱️ LANE B — MALODY RELEASES (Detailed)

### Definition

Slightly comical or clever "malodies" — parody-adjacent content built from existing ideas/assets when possible.

### Purpose

- **Reach new listeners fast** (virality potential)
- **Drive traffic to serious releases** (the funnel)
- **Low production overhead** (repurpose existing material)
- **High volume output** (content machine)

### Format Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

| Rule | Specification | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| Length | 30-120 seconds | Short-form algorithm optimization |
| Hook Start | Within 3-5 seconds | Immediate engagement, prevent scroll |
| Punchline | By 15-25 seconds | Payoff before viewer drops off |
| Audio | Professional quality | Credibility, even in comedy |

### Cadence Options

- **Option A:** 1 malody drop per week
- **Option B:** 2 malody clips per week

### Source Priority (Use What We Have)

1. Extract hooks from existing catalog
2. Rebuild structure (shorter intro, faster payoff)
3. Repurpose existing video into 10-30 sec clips
4. Convert song concepts into malody format

### Malody Post Template

```

### Success Metrics for Lane B

- Views / reach
- Shares (strongest signal)
- Profile visits
- Follow-through to Spotify (link clicks)
- Comments / engagement

---

## 🔄 THE FUNNEL (EXECUTION RULES)

### Every Malody MUST Include

1. **Link to latest serious single**
   - In bio (always updated)
   - Pinned comment on video
   - Caption mention

2. **Clear CTA (Call-to-Action)**
   - "Save [Song Name] on Spotify"
   - "Follow for more"
   - "Link in bio"

3. **Platform-Specific Optimization**
   - TikTok: trending sounds, effects, hashtags
   - Reels: music sticker linking to Spotify
   - YouTube Shorts: end screen, cards, description link

---

## 📊 CONTENT RATIO

### Ideal Weekly Mix

| Content Type | Quantity | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Malody clips | 2-3 | Discovery, reach |
| Behind-the-scenes | 1-2 | Connection, authenticity |
| Teaser/countdown | 1 (if release approaching) | Hype building |
| Engagement (stories, polls) | Daily | Algorithm favor, community |

### Monthly Ratio

- **Lane A content:** 20-30% (quality over quantity)
- **Lane B content:** 70-80% (volume drives discovery)

## ⚡ USE WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE

### Transformation Priority

```
EXISTING ASSETS                    TRANSFORMED OUTPUT
───────────────                    ──────────────────
Full song (3:00)        ──────►    30-sec hook clip (malody)
Long intro              ──────►    Cut to hook immediately
Music video             ──────►    5-10 short clips
B-roll footage          ──────►    Behind-the-scenes content
Unreleased ideas        ──────►    Malody experiments
Old demos               ──────►    "From the vault" content
```

### Catalog Audit Questions

For each existing song, ask:

1. Where is the strongest hook? (Timestamp it)
2. Can the hook stand alone as 30-60 seconds?
3. What makes it funny/clever/shareable if shortened?
4. Does video content exist for this track?
5. Could this become a malody with light rework?

| Post malody without CTA | Always link to serious release |
| Make everything a malody | Balance with authentic content |
| Ignore what's working | Double down on winning formats |
| Create from scratch every time | Repurpose, remix, recut existing assets |
