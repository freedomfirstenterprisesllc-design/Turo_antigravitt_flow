# SECTION 1: GET ME THE 2 SONGS FROM YOUR iPHONE

### What This Means

You have 2 songs on your iPhone that were texted to you. I need those files moved to this computer so I can work with them.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Option A: AirDrop (Fastest - Mac to iPhone)**

1. On your **iPhone**, open the **Messages app**
2. Find the conversation with the 2 songs
3. Tap on one of the audio files (it might show as a link or attachment)
4. Tap the **Share button** (square with arrow pointing up)
5. Tap **"Save to Files"**
6. Choose **"iCloud Drive"** or **"On My iPhone"**
7. Repeat for the second song
8. Now on your **MacBook**, open **Finder**
9. Click **AirDrop** in the sidebar
10. On iPhone, go to **Files app**, find the songs
11. Tap **Share** → **AirDrop** → Select your MacBook
12. Accept on Mac
13. Drag files to this folder on Mac:

```
Documents > FreedomFirstEnterprises_Turo_AI > Turo_antigravitt_flow > austin_powers > assets > audio
```

**Option B: Email to Yourself (Easier)**

1. On iPhone, find the songs in Messages
2. Tap and hold on the audio file
3. Tap **Share** → **Mail**
4. Send to: `freedomfirstenterprisesllc@gmail.com`
5. On your computer, open Gmail
6. Download the attachments
7. Move files to:

```
Documents > FreedomFirstEnterprises_Turo_AI > Turo_antigravitt_flow > austin_powers > assets > audio
```

**Option C: Just Tell Me They're in Your Email**

1. Forward the songs to yourself via email (or they might already be there)
2. Let me know and I can help you download them

### ✅ When Done, Tell Me

"Songs are in the audio folder" — and I'll take it from there.

# SECTION 2: CONNECT SOCIAL MEDIA TO SPOTIFY

### What This Means

Right now, Teddy Lindross's Spotify has NO social media links. When fans find the music, they can't follow anywhere else. We need to fix that.

### What You Need

- Access to **Spotify for Artists** (the app or website where you manage Teddy's profile)
- Instagram, TikTok, or any social accounts for Teddy

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Get Into Spotify for Artists**

1. On your phone or computer, go to: **artists.spotify.com**
2. Log in with the account that owns Teddy Lindross
3. If you've never done this, click **"Claim Your Profile"** and follow the steps

**Step 2: Add Social Links**

1. Once inside, click on **"Profile"** in the menu
2. Look for **"Edit Profile"** or **"Links"**
3. Add your Instagram, TikTok, website, etc.
4. Save changes

### ✅ When Done, Tell Me

"Social links added" — and I'll verify they show up.

# SECTION 3: TELL ME ABOUT THE ARTISTS

### What This Means

I need to understand Member A and Member B better so I can help shape the brand.

### Questions (Just Answer in Your Own Words)

1. **What's the vibe?** (Funny? Serious? Chill? Hype?)
2. **Who are the fans?** (Age range? What do they like?)
3. **What makes Teddy Lindross different?**
4. **Any songs or artists that inspire the sound?**
5. **What's the personality on camera?** (Goofy? Cool? Mysterious?)

### ✅ Just Reply With

Whatever comes to mind — short answers are fine.

# SECTION 4: GIVE ME ACCESS TO DOWNLOAD SPOTIFY SONGS

### What This Means

I want to listen to the existing Teddy Lindross songs and find the best hooks to turn into malodies.

### The Problem

Spotify doesn't let me download the actual audio files. Only the artist has access to the original files.

### What You Can Do

**Option A: Send Me the Original Files**
If you have the original MP3s or WAVs of the songs on Spotify, put them in:

```
austin_powers > assets > audio
```

**Option B: Tell Me Where They Are**
If the original files are on a hard drive, Google Drive, or somewhere else — tell me and I'll help you find them.

**Option C: Re-record Hooks**
If original files are lost, Member A and B can re-record just the hook sections (30-60 seconds) using:

- iPhone 15 Pro Max (voice memos or camera)
- DJI Mini Mic 2 for better audio quality

### ✅ When Done, Tell Me

"Original files are in [location]" or "We need to re-record"
